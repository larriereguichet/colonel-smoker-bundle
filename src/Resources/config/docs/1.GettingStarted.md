```

```yaml
# config/packages/test/lag_smoker.yaml
lag_smoker:
    host: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' # This is the default configuration
    # This route will be used to generated urls to test against
    routes:
        # The homepage route has no parameters and expect a 200 OK response code
        app.homepage: ~
        # The show article requires parameters. They will be provided by the mapping "article"
        app.show_article:
            mapping: article
    # The mapping will be used to generated urls with dynamic parameters
    mapping:
        # This name can be anything, but it has to be unique
        article:
            # This mapping will be used with the Article entity of your application
            entity: App\JK\CmsBundle\Entity\Article
            # The property id in the route parameters (/articles/{id} for example) will be mapped with id property of your entity
            requirements:
                id: id
```

## Usage
1. First generate the URL cache :
```bash
bin/console smoker:generate-cache
```

2. Then run the smoke tests :
```bash
bin/console smoker:smoke
```

> If you use the Symfony WebServer bundle, dont forget to run `bin/console server:start --env=test`.

## Commands
The `generate-cache` command generates a smoker.cache file in the cache directory containing all urls to request. Then 
the `smoke` command request each urls and call the response handler to check its validity against the configuration.
