# URL Providers
## Symfony provider
The **Colonel Smoker** provides a built-in provider named 'symfony' which use the Symfony routing of your application 
to build urls.

However you can create your own provider.

## Static urls

Generating a static url is easier than a dynamic one as it does requires parameters. 
It can be declared with the following configuration :

```yaml
lag_smoker:
    routes:
        my_app.homepage: ~ 
        my_app.a_static_route: ~
```

With this configuration, the **Colonel Smoker** will generate urls for routes `my_app.homepage` and 
`my_app.a_static_route`. Those urls will called and check if the response code is 200. 

## Handle dynamic URLs
Most of the urls of a website are dynamic. It requires dynamic parameters to be generated. The **Colonel Smoker** has a 
built-in requirements provider using Doctrine to find parameter values. This is useful as in most Symfony's application,
urls are build using data from the database.

### Doctrine provider
The **Colonel Smoker** comes with a built-in requirements providers for routes. It use the Doctrine ORM to find data to
fill urls dynamic values. It can also handle static values.

The mapping between database data and urls parameters can be configured in the `mapping` section as following :
```yaml
lag_smoker:
     mapping:
        # A unique name
        article:
            # It should the fully-qualified class name of a valid entity            
            entity: App\Entity\Article
            
            # This is the default value, you can omit it 
            provider: default
            
            # The pattern for the routes related to the entity. This example will take all routes with a name containing app.article_ 
            pattern: 'app.article_'
            
            # But it will excludes this specific routes
            excludes:
                - app.article.excluded_route
            
            # If you only have one dynamic route in this mapping, you can remove the above pattern and excludes 
            # configuration and uncomment the following line  
            # route: app.article.show
            
            # Requirements are mandatory
            requirements:
                # This will map the "id" parameters contained in routes with the id property of the entity
                # To get the value, it will search for getId() or public property id
                id: id
                # It can also take a value from a linked entity, for example the slug of the article category
                categorySlug: category.slug
                slug: slug
                # This value is static, it should be preceded by @
                version: '@v1'
```
This configuration will map all routes with a name containing the pattern `app.article` but the route `app.article.excluded_route`.
The **Colonel Smoker** will use the Doctrine ORM to find all `Article` entities, and get an url for each of them.

Parameters required for some routes will be filled with values found using the given mapping in the requirements section
of the configuration.

For example, the route "app.article_show" which is defined with `/articles/{id}` will be generated for each Article in
your database, and the `id` parameters will be mapped with the getId() method of your entities. For the route "app.articles_by_category" 
(`/{categorySlug}/{slug}) will be mapped by the getCategory()->getSlug() methods (or public properties) and the slug 
parameters by the getSlug() method of the article entity.

You can also pass static values for some reason. To do this, just add `@` before the value. 

### Custom requirements provider
If the url to be tested is more complex to generate, you can use a custom requirements provider by declaring a service 
which implements `\LAG\SmokerBundle\Url\Requirements\Provider\RequirementsProviderInterface`. It will be loaded 
automatically to the requirements provider registry and will be available to retrieve with its name.

```php
   
class MyRequirementsProvider implements RequirementsProviderInterface 
{   
    public function getName(): string
    {
        return 'my_provider';
    }

    public function supports(string $routeName): bool
    {
        return 'my_route' === $routeName;
    }

    public function getRequirements(string $routeName, array $options = []): Traversable
    {
        // ...
        foreach ($things as $stuff) {
            $parameters = [
                'id' => $stuff->getId(),
            ];
            
            // You can return a traversable object, or better use yield to return a generator 
            yield $parameters;       
       }
    }
```

## Custom URL provider
When the route is too complex to build (permissions, complex data...), or if you want more flexibility, you can directly 
provide a collection of url. You can also create a custom url provider by declaring a service which implements 
`LAG\SmokerBundle\Url\Provider\UrlProviderInterface`.

```php
class MyCustomUrlProvider implements UrlProviderInterface
{
    public function getCollection(array $options = []): UrlCollection
    {
        $collection = new UrlCollection();
        
        // Fill the collection with your urls
        
        return $collection;
    }

    public function match(string $path): string
    {
        // The provider should be able to match an url and give the associated route name
        $routeName = '...';
        
        return $routeName;
    }

    public function supports(string $path): bool
    {
        // The provider should be able to say if the given path is supported
        return $path === '/articles";
    }

    public function configure(OptionsResolver $resolver)
    {
    }

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return 'my_little_provider';
    }
}
```

Then configure your routes to use it:
```yaml
lag_smoker:
    # ...
    app.homepage:
        provider: symfony
    my_weird_route:
        provider: my_little_provider
```
