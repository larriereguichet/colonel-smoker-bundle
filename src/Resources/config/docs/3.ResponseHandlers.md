# Response handlers
The **Colonel Smoker** use response handlers to test if the given response is valid to pass the test. It comes with a
built-in handlers checking response status code. You can also add your own handlers to test the returned content for 
example.

## Status code response handler
Most of the time, an url should respond a 200 OK status code. This is the default configuration. But sometimes, you may 
want expect different values to be valid. 302 can be a valid value. We can also want to test the 500 exception page.

In this case you can configure the expected response code in the route configuration :
```yaml
lag_smoker:
    routes:
        route_with_redirection:
            handlers:
                response_code: 302
        route_with_error:
            handlers:
                response_code: 500
```

## Custom response handler
You can also add your custom response handler by creating a service which implements 
`LAG\SmokerBundle\Response\Handler\ResponseHandlerInterface`.

```php

class MyResponseHandler implements LAG\SmokerBundle\Response\Handler\ResponseHandlerInterface
{
    public function handle(string $routeName, Crawler $crawler, Client $client, array $options = []): void
    {
        // Check if the html contains the required code...
    }
}
```
